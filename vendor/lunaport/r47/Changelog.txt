r47:
- no longer include LunaPort_debug.exe, the filesize has grown too much
- add Lobby, LobbyComment and DisplayLobbyComments options to lunaport.ini
- add simple lobby functionality (using HTTP, no chat)
- add KeepHosting option to lunaport.ini
- allow hosting to be cancelled with Esc key
- clarify readme about button config
- add license header to source code files
- let's remember: when distributing binaries of code, which is based on gpl code, we have to distribute the source code too
- add actual gnu gpl license text to lunaport archive, before it was only mentioned in the readme
- minor bugfix

r46:
- add KeepSessionLog and SessionLog to lunaport.ini
- add session log functionality; character and stage names are taken from filenames (why is Haruka's file named Yukari? others look wrong too)
- add MaxPoints option to lunaport.ini, in case some games do not use best of three
- add recognition for lost/won matches
- ignore multiple protocol level errors from same host, one error message is enough
- add note about former desync sources and differences between r38 and r40-r46 to readme
- add player names to replay filename
- clarify "invalid protocol version" error message (depending on version, either "peer's LunaPort is too old" or "peer's LunaPort is newer, please upgrade")

r45:
- accept bigger input resend requests
- revert to r43, reapply KGT mismatch error fix (r44 had low stability, and no performance gain)

r44:
- switch from mutexes to critical sections and from semaphores to metered sections (possible slight performance gain)
- fix KGT mismatch error messages, received value was always displayed as 0

r43:
- tweak spectator mode, bump protocol version (will likely still require more adjustments in the future)
- add some more debug info for access violations
- fix spectator mode
- fix ping recalculation on entering 0 as delay
- some network fixes
- add breakpoint profiling to debug build
- both r39 and r40 had protocol version bumps, forgot to note it then

r42:
- add replay playback speed display to title bar
- fixed bug with q and w replay controls

r41:
- add pause, fast-forward and slow-motion controls for replay playback (see Readme.txt)

r40:
- network synchronize stage settings
- stage blacklist is, by default, not used for local (mode 3) games
- blacklist stages 6 and 7 by default in lunaport.ini, because of low FPS
- add stage blacklist as StageBlacklist and UseBlacklistLocal settings in lunaport.ini
- ensure all players use identical game versions (crc32 and size of KGT file)
- ensure game exe is compatible to lunaport (crc32 and size of exe)
- correctly NOP any foreign breakpoints
- no longer write NOP to DLL address space, this might fix random crashes
- the impossible should no longer happen

r39:
- closing connection should close the game now, instead of freezing
- misc bug fixes

r37:
- fixes for input request/resend code (works now?)

- fix possible freeze with spectators connecting to host before client
- add AskSpectate value in lunaport.ini, to allow disabling of spectate question on failed join
- save player names to replays
- add --local commandline switch for mode 3, replay recording setting from lunaport.ini is respected

r30:
- display player names in game title bar (DisplayNames)
- ask if player wants to spectate, if joining is not possible

r29:
- rename packaged game.ini so configuration is not so easily overwritten
- add player names, configurable in lunaport.ini (PlayerName)
- spectator mode should be fixed for real now
- improved handshake, bumped protocol version
- denied spectators should get correct error message now

r28:
- fixed some compiler warnings
- actually, spectator mode still didn't work, more fixes
- no more invalid iterators during spectator cleanup (possible crash)
- another fix to delay calculation
- name of game exe is now configurable as GameExe in lunaport.ini (adapted from lunapoton)

r27:
- spectator mode works now
- re-enable -O2

r26:
- another general fix

r25:
- possible fix for general brokenness
- fix for spectator mode
- more debug log information
- "activate" host's lunaport window on connection

r24:

- option for FPS display in lunaport.ini (DisplayFramerate)
- add FPS and input per second display to title bar

r23:
- remove temporary measurement code

r22:
- add more debug log information for spectator mode
- readjust delay calculation once more
- use measurements
- added temporary measurement code for inputs/second
- tweak network constants, bump protocol version

r21:
- fix to spectator mode

r20:
- readjust delay calculation (seems better for now)

r19:
- fix replay recording of single player mode in network game
- hopefully improved netcode
- no more -O2

r18:
- lots of testing

r17:
- another change for that part, maybe it's better now

r16:
- fix for netcode bug introduced in r13

r15:
- add setting for number of stages to lunaport.ini
- allow host to specify delay
- smarter user input code

r14:
- allow configuration of port in lunaport.ini
- add support for configuration file

r13:
- lame, experimental lag spike compensation
- increase initial spectator buffer

r12:
- quick fix for spectator mode, still experimental
- enable -O2 for compilation

r11:
- experimental spectator support
- improved handshake should eliminate "invalid handshake sequence" on client side due to out-of-order packets

r6:
- forgot to implement the most important part. oops

r5:
- hopefully improved netcode

r4:
- redesign input hooks
- much more logging, debug output to log
- no locking for print, temporary "fix" for lockups. what's wrong there?

r3:
- small fixes

r2:
- added lots of logging to debug build
- fixed some small bugs in delay calculation
